# PHP BANK CMS APPLICATION

This application was created as my learning objective.
Simply to learn php CRUD and stuff.
This is the third attempt to create PHP BANK CMS, only by adding database:MariaDB as an alternative for FileBase (.json).

## Deployment

To deploy this project place it in apache server.
I have created virtual HOST on my machine that pairs:
http://bank.meh/ domain with ROOT."public" directory.
So you should either create it too, or modify all the code by yourself.

The default credentials for entering CMS is:
user : admin
password: admin
